## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

In future projects I'd like to focus more on Flexbox. It's still such a confusing aspect to me that I'd like to get more exposure to the different so I don't always have to check the docs for every little thing.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with implementing and getting the Flexbox to work the way I wanted it to.
